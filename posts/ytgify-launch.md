[ytgify](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ytgify/dnljofakogbecppbkmnoffppkfdmpfje) is now live in the Chrome Web Store!

It's a simple Chrome extension that lets you easily clip GIFs right from YouTube, by adding a simple interface directly to the YouTube player itself.  You can select your start time, gif duration, resolution and FPS, and even add text!

<div style="max-width: 800px; margin: 2rem auto;">

</div>

Before making the extension, clipping GIFs off of YouTube was a slow and painful process, involving multiple apps to download the YouTube video, bring it into an editor, clip it, export as a GIF, etc. Now it's a breeze.

Shared this out and was happy to see others liked it too - the extension got solid traction on Reddit ([r/SideProject](https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1ntgjnn/a_youtubetogif_chrome_extension/), [r/ClaudeAI](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1ntgb1c/youtube_gif_chrome_extension_built_with_claude/)) before launch.

Within the first week of sharing it out, we have over 1500 users!
