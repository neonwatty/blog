[ytgify](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ytgify/dnljofakogbecppbkmnoffppkfdmpfje) - a YouTube to GIF converter with no watermark - is now live in the Chrome Web Store!

It's a free GIF maker Chrome extension that lets you easily clip GIFs right from YouTube, by adding a simple video clipper interface directly to the YouTube player itself.  You can select your start time, gif duration, resolution and FPS, and even add text!

Before making the extension, clipping GIFs off of YouTube was a slow and painful process, involving multiple apps to download the YouTube video, bring it into an editor, clip it, export as a GIF, etc. Now it's a breeze.

Shared this out and was happy to see others liked it too - the extension got solid traction on Reddit ([r/SideProject](https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1ntgjnn/a_youtubetogif_chrome_extension/), [r/ClaudeAI](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1ntgb1c/youtube_gif_chrome_extension_built_with_claude/)) before launch.

Within the first week of sharing it out, we have over 1500 users!
