# Modern CSS Techniques for 2025

CSS continues to evolve at a rapid pace, bringing us powerful new features that make web development more intuitive and flexible. In this post, we'll explore the most exciting CSS techniques that are shaping web design in 2025.

## Container Queries: The Game Changer

Container queries allow you to style elements based on the size of their containing element, not just the viewport. This is revolutionary for component-based design.

```css
.card-container {
  container-type: inline-size;
  container-name: card;
}

@container card (min-width: 400px) {
  .card {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr;
    gap: 1rem;
  }
}
```

### Why Container Queries Matter

- **True component responsiveness**: Components adapt to their container, not the viewport
- **Better reusability**: Components work in any context
- **Cleaner code**: Less dependency on global media queries

## Cascade Layers: Organizing Your Styles

Cascade layers provide explicit control over the cascade, making it easier to manage styles in large projects.

```css
@layer reset, base, components, utilities;

@layer reset {
  * {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    box-sizing: border-box;
  }
}

@layer components {
  .button {
    padding: 0.5rem 1rem;
    border: none;
    border-radius: 0.25rem;
  }
}

@layer utilities {
  .text-center {
    text-align: center;
  }
}
```

## Subgrid: Perfect Alignment

Subgrid allows nested grids to align with their parent grid, solving complex layout challenges.

```css
.main-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
  gap: 1rem;
}

.card {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-rows: subgrid;
  grid-row: span 3;
}
```

## :has() Selector: Parent Selection

The `:has()` pseudo-class enables parent selection based on child elements.

```css
/* Style a card differently if it has an image */
.card:has(img) {
  border: 2px solid blue;
}

/* Style form when it has invalid inputs */
.form:has(:invalid) {
  border-color: red;
}
```

## Modern Color Spaces

CSS now supports wider color gamuts and better color management.

```css
.element {
  /* Using P3 color space */
  color: color(display-p3 1 0.5 0);
  
  /* Using LCH for perceptually uniform colors */
  background: lch(70% 50 180);
  
  /* Using relative color syntax */
  border-color: hsl(from var(--primary) h s calc(l - 20%));
}
```

## Advanced Custom Properties

CSS custom properties are becoming more powerful with new features.

```css
@property --gradient-angle {
  syntax: '<angle>';
  initial-value: 0deg;
  inherits: false;
}

.gradient-element {
  background: linear-gradient(var(--gradient-angle), red, blue);
  animation: rotate-gradient 2s infinite linear;
}

@keyframes rotate-gradient {
  to {
    --gradient-angle: 360deg;
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

These modern CSS techniques are already changing how we build websites. While browser support varies, progressive enhancement allows us to use these features today while providing fallbacks for older browsers.

The future of CSS is bright, with even more exciting features on the horizon!
