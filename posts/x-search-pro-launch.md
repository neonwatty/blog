[X Search Pro](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/x-search-pro/belfofaehpmgnifoddppdfgofflnkoja) is now live in the Chrome Web Store!

Even after pruning my X / Twitter feed of unwanted clickbait posts (e.g., politics, tech drama) I still felt like the signal to noise ratio in my feed was too low.

I first tried using X's search features to make regular queries for topics I'm interested in (e.g., "Claude Code", "Hugging Face"), but found myself clicking around all the time to re-create / update the time window on these queries.

So I built this simple Chrome extension.  X Search Pro solves this with smart saved searches that automatically update their time ranges.  Set it once, use it forever.  You can categorize and color-code your saved searches, and - if you so desire - they can always be within reach in a nice sidebar that's always accessible on x.com.
